  <p>This program has so far provided me with the knowledge of knowing how a webpage is built from the scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    So far, I have been able to learn the basic skills of <b>html</b> and <b>css</b>, and also understand some terminologies like <em>server</em>, <em>API</em>, <em>database</em> etc that are used in the functionality of a website.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have also been able to build some basic webpage structures using html.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, I have learnt how to style a webpage interface using css.
  </p>
  <p>
    This program has also taught me on how to collaborate with friends in sharing ideas. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Another important thing that i have gained from this program is the different platforms that one can access more learnig resources.
