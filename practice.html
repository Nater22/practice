          When styling a web page, there are many types of selectors available that allow
developers to be as broad or as specific as they need to be when selecting HTML
elements to apply CSS rules to.
Here you will learn about some of the common CSS selectors that you will use as a
developer.
Element Selectors
The element selector allows developers to select HTML elements based on their
element type.
For example, if you use p as the selector, the rule will apply to all p elements on the
webpage.
